PROJECT: Custom 32-bit Secure Processor

CPU TYPE:
- Custom-designed processor
- 32-bit architecture
- Software-based execution with hardware modeling using Verilog

REGISTERS:
- General purpose registers: R0, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7
- Register width: 32 bits
- Special registers: PC (Program Counter), FLAGS

MEMORY:
- Code Memory: Stores instructions
- Data Memory: Stores data values

EXECUTION MODEL:
- Fetch instruction from Code Memory using PC
- Decode instruction fields
- Execute instruction
- Update PC
- Repeat until HALT instruction

SECURITY GOAL:
- Illegal instructions should stop execution
- Invalid jumps should be blocked
- Code memory should not be modified during execution
